# Bref Laravel Bridge

Run Laravel on AWS Lambda with [Bref](https://bref.sh/).

Read the [Bref documentation for Laravel](https://bref.sh/docs/frameworks/laravel.html) to get started.

## Background

This package was originally created by [CacheWerk](https://github.com/cachewerk/) (the creators of [Relay](https://relay.so)), maintained by [Till Kr√ºss](https://github.com/tillkruss) and [George Boot](https://github.com/georgeboot). It was published at [cachewerk/bref-laravel-bridge](https://github.com/cachewerk/bref-laravel-bridge).

For Bref 2.0, the contributors joined the Bref organization and CacheWerk's bridge was merged into this repository to create v2.0 of the bridge.

## Documentation

The documentation is available at [bref.sh/docs/frameworks/laravel.html](https://bref.sh/docs/frameworks/laravel.html).
